LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF PLSSSS! I'm a CS student and a total language nerd. Honestly, I'm just grinding through code by day and binging foreign content by night. I've already got English down pat(?!?!), but I'm currently vibing with like 15 other languages. My goal? To become a global dev who can flex in any tongue. 

And, I also like Mathematics. Now, I'm interested in group theory. This is very very beautiful theoryyyy. u should learn. My goal was mathematician, but now i wanna become a literally MULTILINGUAL and IT guy. yeah.
